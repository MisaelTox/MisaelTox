# ☁️ Hi, I'm Misael — Cloud Engineer

**Sociology Graduate 🎓 → Cloud Architect 🚀**
*Specializing in Infrastructure as Code (Terraform), Serverless Architectures, and Container Orchestration.*

---

### 💼 Professional Focus
I design scalable, automated, and cost-efficient cloud architectures. My expertise lies in **modernizing legacy setups** into serverless environments, specifically using **AWS Fargate** and **Terraform** for full reproducibility.

### 🚀 Featured Cloud Implementations (Customized Forks)
*I specialize in taking open-source tools and architecting their production-ready deployment on AWS.*

| Project | My Contribution | Tech Stack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Uptime Kuma Cloud](https://github.com/MisaelTox/uptime-kuma)** | Architected a **Serverless deployment** with persistent storage (EFS) and automated email alerts. | AWS Fargate, EFS, SNS, Terraform |
| **[Minecraft Server AWS](https://github.com/MisaelTox/minecraft-server-aws-ecs-fargate)** | Optimized cost-efficiency using **Fargate Spot** and automated world persistence logic. | Terraform, Docker, ECS |
| **[Kavita Cloud Vault](https://github.com/MisaelTox/kavita-cloud-vault)** | Built a custom **Serverless Manga Reader** infra with automated mounting points. | HCL, Terraform, AWS |

### 🧠 Technical Core

* **IaC:** Advanced **Terraform** (Modularity, Remote State, Workspaces).
* **Compute & Orchestration:** AWS ECS (Fargate), EC2, Docker Compose.
* **Storage & Networking:** EFS (Complex Mounting), S3, VPC (Public/Private Subnets), IAM (Least Privilege).
* **Automation:** Bash Scripting, Python, GitHub Actions.

### ⭐ Why Work With Me?
* **Serverless First:** Expert in migrating expensive EC2 setups to cost-effective Fargate architectures.
* **Persistence Specialist:** I solve the "stateless container" problem using advanced EFS integration.
* **Analytical Background:** My Sociology degree gives me a unique perspective on system behavior, documentation, and complex problem-solving.
